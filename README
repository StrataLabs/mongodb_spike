The objective of this spike is to see
- What it takes to add customizable forms using MongoDB
  (The idea is that one approach would be to generate these from a Yaml definition, for example)
  See purchase_order_controller_spec.rb
   
- Explore MongoDB's querying capabilities. We want to check for things like finding stray purchase orders, bills, etc.
